## Technology Used

Next.js, React (client-side), Apollo Strapi v3.0.0-alpha.13.0.1, Node v10.0.0

### Services Used
Amazon S3 for image upload

## Getting Started

### Frontend
We are using Next.js, and Apollo on start - you should be rendering our live website data but soon we'll be making a local test database in order to further limit access to our internal API.

In order to run, simply clone this repository, and run:

    $ yarn
    $ yarn dev
    
### Backend

To be updated. 

## How to Contribute

1.  [Set up the development environment properly.](#setting-up-the-development-environment)

2.  Look for an open issue (could be a feature or a bugfix) or create one of
    your own (so we know you're working on a new thing!)

3.  Create a branch with `git checkout -b feature/<my-awesome-feature>` for a
    feature or `git checkout -b fix/<my-cool-fix>` for a fix.

4.  Write some badass code.

5.  Stage your files with `git add <files I want to update>` or `git add .`.
    (The latter adds all the files in the current directory, so **be careful!**)

6.  Commit your changes with
    `git commit -m <a commit message explaining what you did>`.

    * **Important**: Don't commit secret keys or any sort of sensitive
      information into git! Always use `git status` to double check if you're
      not sure.

7.  Push your commits with `git push`. The push will usually fail for a brand
    new feature branch. Just follow the instructions on your terminal to resolve
    it.

8.  Create a pull request (request to merge your branch into the master branch)
    using the button on Github!

## Future Plans

- [] Migrating our back-end from Strapi to an headless Wordpress instance
- [] Migrate to utilizing Docker
- [] Deploy onto Google Cloud
